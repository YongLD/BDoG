Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below. Gordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft. So, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung. Figure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.
Question: Which of the following could Gordon's test show?
Options:
A. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour
B. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour
C. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment. Read the passage and think about the variables that are described. Kenneth wanted to grow cucumbers from seeds. He read that using a heating pad to heat up potting soil could help make seeds germinate, or sprout, faster. Kenneth wondered whether the temperature of the heating pad would affect how quickly the seeds germinated. Kenneth prepared two potting trays, each made up of ten small pots of soil. He planted one cucumber seed in each small pot and arranged the potting trays near a sunny window. He set an electric heating pad to 75°F and placed it under one potting tray. He set a second heating pad to 85°F and placed it under the other potting tray. Kenneth observed the pots daily, and he counted the number of days it took until a seed germinated in each pot. Hint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating. A dependent variable is a variable that you measure. Figure: germinating plants in a potting tray.
Question: Which of the following was a dependent variable in this experiment?
Options:
A. the temperature of the heating pad

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below. Linda applied a thin layer of wax to the underside of her snowboard and rode the board straight down a hill. Then, she removed the wax and rode the snowboard straight down the hill again. She repeated the rides four more times, alternating whether she rode with a thin layer of wax on the board or not. Her friend Bob timed each ride. Linda and Bob calculated the average time it took to slide straight down the hill on the snowboard with wax compared to the average time on the snowboard without wax. Figure: snowboarding down a hill.
Question: Identify the question that Linda and Bob's experiment can best answer.
Options:
A. Does Linda's snowboard slide down a hill in less time when it has a thin layer of wax or a thick layer of wax?
B. Does Linda's snowboard slide down a hill in less time when it has a layer of wax or when it does not have a layer of wax?

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below. Kira prepared ten buckets, each with one gallon of boiling water and three tablespoons of black fabric dye. Kira soaked white linen fabric squares in five of the buckets, and white cotton fabric squares in the other five buckets. All of the fabric squares were soaked for 15 minutes. After the fabric dried, Kira scored the darkness of the squares on a scale from light to dark. She compared the darkness of the linen fabric to the darkness of the cotton fabric. Figure: fabric that has been dyed black.
Question: Identify the question that Kira's experiment can best answer.
Options:
A. Does linen fabric turn darker than cotton fabric when soaked in a mixture of black dye and water?
B. Does fabric turn darker when soaked in a mixture of black dye and water for 15 minutes compared to 30 minutes?

Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question. White sea urchins live in tropical oceans. Sea urchins are covered with hard, sharp spines. These spear-like spines protect the sea urchin from predators, such as fish. Sometimes a small worm, called a bristle worm, also uses the spines for protection. The worm lives on the sea urchin, between the spines. To attack a worm on the sea urchin's body, a fish would have to get past the spines. When the worm lives on the sea urchin, the worm does not change the sea urchin's ability to survive. Figure: a white sea urchin in the ocean.
Question: Which type of relationship is formed when a bristle worm lives on a white sea urchin?
Options:
A. mutualistic
B. commensal
C. parasitic

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below. Dakota planted 25 tomato seeds one-half inch below the soil surface in each of six pots. Dakota added an equal amount of fertilizer to three of the six pots. She placed the pots in a plant growth chamber where all the seeds experienced the same temperature, amount of light, and humidity level. After two weeks, Dakota counted the number of seedlings that grew in each pot. She compared the number of seedlings in the pots with fertilizer to the number of seedlings in the pots without fertilizer. Figure: tomato seedlings growing in soil.

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below. Wind turbines use wind power to produce electricity. Rose was a materials engineer who designed wind turbines. She wanted to design a new turbine that would produce 10% more electricity than older wind turbines. She thought that a turbine made from lightweight material would turn more easily and produce more electricity. So, Rose created a computer model of a turbine made from lightweight material. Then she used the model to calculate how much more electricity the new turbine could produce compared to the older turbines. Figure: studying a wind turbine computer model.
Question: Which of the following could Rose's test show?
Options:
A. if the new turbine could turn easily
B. whether the new turbine could produce 10% more electricity
C. how much the new turbine would weigh

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment. Susan wanted to set up a compost bin, where food could decompose, or break down, into soil fertilizer. She knew that worms can break down food. She wondered if adding worms to her compost bin would cause food to decompose faster. Susan set up four small compost containers. She added the same amounts of fruit peels, vegetable scraps, and eggshells to each container. Then, she added worms to two of the containers but not to the other two. After one month, Susan weighed the amount of undecomposed food left in each container. Figure: food decomposing in a compost bin.
Question: In this experiment, which were part of a control group?
Options:
A. the containers that did not get worms
B. the containers that got worms

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below. Tanner used a dropper to put equal-sized drops of pure water, one at a time, onto a penny. The drops stayed together and formed a dome on the penny's surface. Tanner recorded the number of drops he could add before the water spilled over the edge of the penny. Then, he rinsed and dried the penny, and repeated the test using water mixed with hand soap. He repeated these trials on nine additional pennies. Tanner compared the average number of pure water drops to the average number of water drops mixed with hand soap that he could add to a penny before the water spilled over. Figure: a dome of water on the surface of a penny.
Question: Identify the question that Tanner's experiment can best answer.
Options:
A. Can pennies hold more drops of pure water or water mixed with hand soap?
B. Can pennies hold more drops of water mixed with dish soap or water mixed with hand soap?

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below. Logan put one two-inch steel nail into each of six test tubes. He added water to three of the test tubes and vinegar to the other three. In each test tube, he completely covered the nail with the same volume of liquid. Logan checked the nails for rust at the same time every day. He recorded how many days it took each nail to become completely covered in rust. Then, he compared the number of days it took nails to rust in water to the number of days it took nails to rust in vinegar. Figure: a new steel nail on a pile of rusty nails.
Question: Identify the question that Logan's experiment can best answer.
Options:
A. Do steel nails rust in fewer days when submerged in a large volume of liquid compared to a small volume?
B. Do steel nails take fewer days to rust in water compared to vinegar?

Hint: Before sunrise on November 14, 1963, the crew of the fishing boat Isleifur II had just finished putting their fishing lines in the ocean off the southern coast of Iceland. As the crew waited to have breakfast, a strong smell of sulfur drifted over the boat. At first, crew members thought that the cook had burned the eggs or that something was wrong with the boat's engine. But when the sun started to rise, the crew saw black smoke billowing from the water a few kilometers away. The captain of the Isleifur II first thought the smoke was coming from a boat that was on fire, so he sailed closer to try to help. But as the Isleifur II approached the column of smoke, the captain and crew saw glowing pieces of molten rock shooting up out of the water. The captain realized this was not a burning boat. It was a volcano erupting under the water! Figure: the erupting undersea volcano seen by the sailors on the Isleifur II.
Question: According to the text, what evidence of a volcanic eruption did the captain observe?
Options:
A. He heard a report on the radio warning about a volcanic eruption.
B. He saw a nearby boat that was on fire.
C. He smelled sulfur and saw pieces of molten rock shooting out of the water.

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below. Carter put one two-inch steel nail into each of six test tubes. He added water to three of the test tubes and vinegar to the other three. In each test tube, he completely covered the nail with the same volume of liquid. Carter checked the nails for rust at the same time every day. He recorded how many days it took each nail to become completely covered in rust. Then, he compared the number of days it took nails to rust in water to the number of days it took nails to rust in vinegar. Figure: a new steel nail on a pile of rusty nails.
Question: Identify the question that Carter's experiment can best answer.
Options:
A. Do steel nails take fewer days to rust in water compared to vinegar?
B. Do steel nails rust in fewer days when submerged in a large volume of liquid compared to a small volume?

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below. Carter was installing solar panels on the roof of a client's house. The panels had to provide enough electricity to power the house year-round. Carter needed to decide how many panels to install and which side of the roof to install them on. If he put the panels on the side that got the most sun, then he could use fewer panels, and the client would save money. Carter installed sunlight sensors on both sides of the roof. Then, he measured the amount of sunlight the sensors on each side of the roof recorded over one sunny summer day. Figure: installing solar panels on a roof.
Question: Which of the following could Carter's test show?
Options:
A. the amount of sunlight the roof would get throughout the year
B. how many solar panels could fit on each side of the roof
C. which side of the roof got more sun over one day

Hint: Read the text. Biologists can look at how related two animals are by comparing their body parts, or structures. Analogous structures are parts with the same purpose but with different structures, like a fin and a flipper. Different species may develop analogous structures when they live in similar environments even if they aren't closely related. Homologous structures, however, may show that species are related by indicating they have common ancestors. A whale is a mammal, which makes it more closely related to a bear than to a fish, and a whale's flipper has bones like those in a bear's paw. Though they are different shapes and sizes, the arrangement of bones is similar.
Question: Which term matches the picture?

A. analogous structures

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below. Janelle planted 20 radish plants in a greenhouse, putting each plant in its own pot. She placed ten of the pots under bright light and the other ten pots under dim light. Janelle watered all the plants twice a day. After two months, she pulled the radish plants from the ground, threw away the leafy green tops, and measured the sizes of the radishes. She compared the sizes of the radishes grown under bright light to the sizes of the radishes grown under dim light. Figure: a radish plant in soil.
Question: Identify the question that Janelle's experiment can best answer.

Hint: Read the passage about winter coats. People put on winter coats when it's cold outside, and some animals have winter coats, too! They grow extra-thick coats of fur to keep warm in winter. The thick fur traps their body heat and keeps it close to their skin. Many wild animals grow winter coats. But so do some cats and dogs. Some animals, like arctic foxes, also change coat colors in winter. They shed their brown fur and grow thick white coats. Their white coats help them hide from other animals in the snow.
Question: How does thick fur help animals in wintertime?
Options:
A. It keeps them warm by trapping their body heat.
B. It makes them look older.

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment. Read the passage and think about the variables that are described. Dr. Spencer was the land manager for a prairie that had become overrun by unwanted grasses. These grasses crowded out other plants. Dr. Spencer thought that she could use fire to remove the unwanted grasses and allow other plants to grow. But she didn't know how often the prairie should be burned. Dr. Spencer marked off six plots within a large area of the prairie. She used carefully controlled fires to burn all of the plants in each plot. She burned three of the plots once a year for three years. She burned the other three plots twice a year for three years. A year after the last fire, Dr. Spencer counted the number of unwanted grasses in each of the six plots. Hint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating. A dependent variable is a variable that you measure. Figure: a fire burning through a prairie.
Question: Which of the following was an independent variable in this experiment?
Options:
A. the number of times the plots were burned each year
B. the number of unwanted grasses

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below. People with diabetes sometimes take a medicine made from insulin. Insulin can be made by a special type of bacteria. Bridget was a bioengineer who wanted to increase the amount of insulin that the bacteria produced by 20%. She read that giving the bacteria more nutrients could affect the amount of insulin they produced. So, Bridget gave extra nutrients to some of the bacteria. Then, she measured how much insulin those bacteria produced compared to bacteria that did not get extra nutrients. Figure: studying bacteria in a laboratory.
Question: Which of the following could Bridget's test show?
Options:
A. whether producing more insulin would help the bacteria grow faster
B. whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin
C. whether different types of bacteria would need different nutrients to produce insulin

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below. Zach put one two-inch steel nail into each of six test tubes. He added water to three of the test tubes and vinegar to the other three. In each test tube, he completely covered the nail with the same volume of liquid. Zach checked the nails for rust at the same time every day. He recorded how many days it took each nail to become completely covered in rust. Then, he compared the number of days it took nails to rust in water to the number of days it took nails to rust in vinegar. Figure: a new steel nail on a pile of rusty nails.
Question: Identify the question that Zach's experiment can best answer.
Options:
A. Do steel nails rust in fewer days when submerged in a large volume of liquid compared to a small volume?

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below. Brennan was a mechanical engineer who was designing to record temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. The weather station would be used in a town where the highest recorded temperature was 40°C. Brennan wanted to make sure the weather station would work even in unusually warm weather. So, he set an indoor test chamber to 50°C with low moisture and no wind. He left the weather station in the chamber overnight. The next day, he checked to see if the weather station displayed accurate measurements after 24 hours at 50°C. Figure: a weather station.
Question: Which of the following could Brennan's test show?
Options:
A. if the weather station would work when the temperature was 50°C
B. how well the weather station would work when it was windy

Hint: Read the text. The way an animal looks can help to keep it safe from predators. Some animals use camouflage. These animals may blend into their environments so that it is hard for them to be seen. Other animals find safety in being seen. Many venomous animals, for example, have brightly colored skins that warn off predators. Finally, some animals may use mimicry to stay safe. These animals look like, or mimic, venomous animals so that predators will stay away.

Hint: Read the text. In the sciences, it's important to distinguish between the accuracy and precision of measurements. Accuracy refers to how close measured values are to a true value. Precision refers to how close measured values are to each other. A common metaphor used to illustrate the difference between these terms is a bull's-eye, or target. Darts thrown accurately at a bull's-eye all hit close to the center of the target but not necessarily close to each other. Darts thrown precisely at a bull's-eye, by contrast, all hit the same spot but not necessarily at the center of the bull's-eye.

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment. Martina had six air plants on her desk that were not growing. Once a week, she soaked the air plants in water. But she suspected that they needed more water. She wondered if spraying the air plants with water every day in addition to soaking them would help them grow. Martina measured the initial weight of all six air plants. Then, for the next month, she continued to soak all of the air plants once a week. She also sprayed three of the plants every day. At the end of the month, Martina measured the weights of the plants again. Figure: an air plant displayed on a rock.
Question: In this experiment, which were part of an experimental group?
Options:
A. the plants that were soaked in water and sprayed

Hint: The following passage describes the effects of a gene mutation, which is a permanent change in a gene. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below. Muscle movement is controlled by charged atoms called ions. Ions move in and out of muscle cells through tube-like structures called channels. One of these channels is made from the chloride channel protein. The chloride channel protein is encoded by the CLCN1 gene. A certain person had a mutation in the CLCN1 gene. Compared to the CLCN1 gene without a mutation, the mutated CLCN1 gene encoded a form of the chloride channel protein with a different structure. This different form of the chloride channel protein allowed fewer ions than normal to travel through it. The person with the mutation had muscles that were slow to relax, which resulted in muscle stiffness. Having muscle stiffness due to a mutation in the CLCN1 gene is called Thomsen disease. Figure: muscles in the human body.
Question: Complete the sentence.
The mutation in the () affected the structure and function of the ().
Options:
A. chloride channel protein . . . CLCN1 gene
B. CLCN1 gene . . . chloride channel protein

Hint: Read the text about Alex the parrot. Most parrots can speak, or at least copy the sounds of people talking. Alex, an African grey parrot, learned to do much more. He knew how to do simple math. In fact, he was capable of adding up to six objects. Alex added up crackers, jelly beans, and blocks. He could also point out seven different colors and six shapes. And he knew more than a hundred words! Alex's owner taught him for more than thirty years and observed a lot about how parrots learn. People had worked with animals before Alex to see if animals could understand language and math. But Alex proved that animals might be even smarter than we thought!
Question: Based on the text, what was one of the things that made Alex different from most parrots?
Options:
A. He loved playing with blocks.

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below. Mitchell, a materials engineer, was developing a quick-drying fabric for athletic clothing. The fabric needed to absorb one drop of water in less than one second and dry completely in less than five minutes. Mitchell thought a fabric made from cotton and polyester would both absorb water well and dry quickly. But he needed to decide what percentage of each material to use. So, he made a sample fabric that was 50% cotton and 50% polyester. Then he put one drop of water on the sample. He timed how long it took the fabric to dry after the water was absorbed. Figure: fabric that has not absorbed drops of water.
Question: Which of the following could Mitchell's test show?
Options:
A. if the sample fabric would absorb one drop of water in less than one second
B. how much athletes would sweat in the fabric
C. how long it would take the sample fabric to dry after it absorbed one drop of water

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below. Pablo used a dropper to put equal-sized drops of pure water, one at a time, onto a penny. The drops stayed together and formed a dome on the penny's surface. Pablo recorded the number of drops he could add before the water spilled over the edge of the penny. Then, he rinsed and dried the penny, and repeated the test using water mixed with hand soap. He repeated these trials on nine additional pennies. Pablo compared the average number of pure water drops to the average number of water drops mixed with hand soap that he could add to a penny before the water spilled over. Figure: a dome of water on the surface of a penny.
Question: Identify the question that Pablo's experiment can best answer.
Options:
A. Can pennies hold more drops of pure water or water mixed with hand soap?
B. Can pennies hold more drops of water mixed with dish soap or water mixed with hand soap?

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below. Peter put one two-inch steel nail into each of six test tubes. He added water to three of the test tubes and vinegar to the other three. In each test tube, he completely covered the nail with the same volume of liquid. Peter checked the nails for rust at the same time every day. He recorded how many days it took each nail to become completely covered in rust. Then, he compared the number of days it took nails to rust in water to the number of days it took nails to rust in vinegar. Figure: a new steel nail on a pile of rusty nails.
Question: Identify the question that Peter's experiment can best answer.
Options:
A. Do steel nails take fewer days to rust in water compared to vinegar?
B. Do steel nails rust in fewer days when submerged in a large volume of liquid compared to a small volume?

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below. Camille and Lucy were making batches of concrete for a construction project. To make the concrete, they mixed together dry cement powder, gravel, and water. Then, they checked if each batch was firm enough using a test called a slump test. They poured some of the fresh concrete into an upside-down metal cone. They left the concrete in the metal cone for 30 seconds. Then, they lifted the cone to see if the concrete stayed in a cone shape or if it collapsed. If the concrete in a batch collapsed, they would know the batch should not be used. Figure: preparing a concrete slump test.
Question: Which of the following could Camille and Lucy's test show?
Options:
A. if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use
B. if the concrete from each batch took the same amount of time to dry

Hint: Read the text about cats. Cats are among the most popular pets in the world. Millions of people have welcomed cats into their homes. Indeed, researchers believe that the relationship between cats and humans goes back to prehistoric times. But throughout history, different cultures and people around the world have had different sentiments about cats. Such feelings have ranged from fear to worship. People probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East. Farmers were growing and storing grain, which in turn attracted mice and other pests. Cats were wild then. However, they were likely drawn to farming communities because there were mice to hunt. The farmers would have noticed and appreciated these visitors. To keep the cats around, these early farmers may have given food and even shelter to the wild cats. The farmers and cats probably helped one another. It wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way. Later in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night. The connection between witches and black cats lasted for many years. The idea traveled from Europe to North America as Europeans settled there. However, today cats of all colors are beloved by millions of people worldwide. In fact, the way some house cats are treated now might make their Egyptian ancestors jealous!
Question: Based on clues in the text, why would farmers have appreciated cats eight thousand years ago?
Options:
A. The cats were thought to be visiting goddesses.
B. The cats hunted and brought food to the farmers.
C. The cats helped keep the farmers' grain free of mice.
D. The cats helped farmers find better places to store grain.

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below. Gwen built an electric circuit: she used wires to connect a battery to a light bulb, the light bulb to a small piece of copper, and the copper back to the battery. When the circuit was complete, the light turned on. Gwen observed the brightness of the light for five seconds. She then replaced the copper with a piece of iron of equal size and noted whether the light became brighter or dimmer. Gwen built three more of the same type of circuit. She repeated the tests with each circuit. Gwen recorded whether the circuits produced brighter light when the circuit included copper or when the circuit included iron. Figure: a circuit with a battery, a light bulb, and a piece of copper.
Question: Identify the question that Gwen's experiment can best answer.
Options:
A. Do circuits that include iron produce dimmer light than circuits that include copper?
B. Can light bulbs stay lit longer when circuits include copper or when circuits include iron?

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below. People with diabetes sometimes take a medicine made from insulin. Insulin can be made by a special type of bacteria. Kathleen was a bioengineer who wanted to increase the amount of insulin that the bacteria produced by 20%. She read that giving the bacteria more nutrients could affect the amount of insulin they produced. So, Kathleen gave extra nutrients to some of the bacteria. Then, she measured how much insulin those bacteria produced compared to bacteria that did not get extra nutrients. Figure: studying bacteria in a laboratory.
Question: Which of the following could Kathleen's test show?
Options:
A. whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin
B. whether producing more insulin would help the bacteria grow faster
C. whether different types of bacteria would need different nutrients to produce insulin

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below. Laura planted 25 tomato seeds one-half inch below the soil surface in each of six pots. Laura added an equal amount of fertilizer to three of the six pots. She placed the pots in a plant growth chamber where all the seeds experienced the same temperature, amount of light, and humidity level. After two weeks, Laura counted the number of seedlings that grew in each pot. She compared the number of seedlings in the pots with fertilizer to the number of seedlings in the pots without fertilizer. Figure: tomato seedlings growing in soil.
Question: Identify the question that Laura's experiment can best answer.
Options:
A. Does the humidity level where tomato seeds are planted affect the number of tomato seedlings that grow?
B. Do more tomato seedlings grow when they are planted in soil with fertilizer compared to soil without fertilizer?

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below. Hayley was designing small aircraft called drones to pick up items from warehouse shelves. She knew that the drones' propeller blades would get damaged if they bumped into anything while flying through the warehouse. So, Hayley wanted to add blade guards to protect the propeller blades. The guards had to be sturdy so they would not break in a crash. But she thought that if the guards weighed too much, the drones would not fly well. So, Hayley put guards made of lightweight metal on one drone. Then she observed how well the drone flew with the guards. Figure: a drone without blade guards.
Question: Which of the following could Hayley's test show?
Options:
A. how much the drone weighed with the blade guards
B. if the blade guards would break in a crash
C. if adding the blade guards made the drone fly poorly

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below. Pamela and Kimi were making batches of concrete for a construction project. To make the concrete, they mixed together dry cement powder, gravel, and water. Then, they checked if each batch was firm enough using a test called a slump test. They poured some of the fresh concrete into an upside-down metal cone. They left the concrete in the metal cone for 30 seconds. Then, they lifted the cone to see if the concrete stayed in a cone shape or if it collapsed. If the concrete in a batch collapsed, they would know the batch should not be used. Figure: preparing a concrete slump test.
Question: Which of the following could Pamela and Kimi's test show?
Options:
A. if the concrete from each batch took the same amount of time to dry
B. if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below. Sebastian was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft. So, to help decide how big the vent should be, Sebastian put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung. Figure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.
Question: Which of the following could Sebastian's test show?
Options:
A. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour
B. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour
C. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below. Mason was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft. So, to help decide how big the vent should be, Mason put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung. Figure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.
Question: Which of the following could Mason's test show?
Options:
A. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour
B. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour
C. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment. Lester worked in a restaurant that had a vegetable garden. Part of his job was to care for the tomato plants. He had heard that pruning, or trimming, tomato plants can help tomatoes grow. He wondered if pruning would affect how well his tomato plants grew. Lester chose 24 tomato plants that were similar in size. He pruned an equal number of branches from each of the first 12 plants. He left the other 12 plants unpruned. Then, each week, Lester weighed the tomatoes that he picked from each group of plants. Figure: a tomato plant.
Question: In this experiment, which were part of an experimental group?
Options:
A. the unpruned tomato plants
B. the pruned tomato plants

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below. People with diabetes sometimes take a medicine made from insulin. Insulin can be made by a special type of bacteria. Kaylee was a bioengineer who wanted to increase the amount of insulin that the bacteria produced by 20%. She read that giving the bacteria more nutrients could affect the amount of insulin they produced. So, Kaylee gave extra nutrients to some of the bacteria. Then, she measured how much insulin those bacteria produced compared to bacteria that did not get extra nutrients. Figure: studying bacteria in a laboratory.
Question: Which of the following could Kaylee's test show?
Options:
A. whether different types of bacteria would need different nutrients to produce insulin
B. whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin
C. whether producing more insulin would help the bacteria grow faster

Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question below. The tallest sand dunes in North America are in Colorado. In this desert region, the top few inches of sand are usually dry, but the lower layers remain moist year-round. Ord's kangaroo rats spend their entire lives in these dunes. They collect seeds from grasses and prairie sunflowers, and then bury the seeds in the moist layers of sand. Later, the rats come back to eat their buried seeds. The seeds absorb enough moisture from the sand that the kangaroo rats never need to drink water! Figure: Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve in Colorado.
Question: Which of the following best describes a community in the Great Sand Dunes?
Options:
A. the grasses and the prairie sunflowers
B. the Ord's kangaroo rats

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below. Bruce was installing solar panels on the roof of a client's house. The panels had to provide enough electricity to power the house year-round. Bruce needed to decide how many panels to install and which side of the roof to install them on. If he put the panels on the side that got the most sun, then he could use fewer panels, and the client would save money. Bruce installed sunlight sensors on both sides of the roof. Then, he measured the amount of sunlight the sensors on each side of the roof recorded over one sunny summer day. Figure: installing solar panels on a roof.
Question: Which of the following could Bruce's test show?
Options:
A. which side of the roof got more sun over one day
B. how many solar panels could fit on each side of the roof
C. the amount of sunlight the roof would get throughout the year

Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question. Hawk moths visit many types of plants to find nectar, including petunias. Petunias produce nectar deep inside their flowers. To reach the nectar, a moth puts its long, tubular mouthpart, called a proboscis, inside a flower. While the moth drinks nectar, pollen from the flower sticks to the moth's head and proboscis. Later, the moth visits another petunia flower to drink more nectar. When pollen on the moth's head and proboscis is transferred to the female part of the other flower, that flower is pollinated. After the moth pollinates the flower, the petunia is able to reproduce. Figure: a hawk moth visiting a petunia flower.
Question: Which type of relationship is formed when a hawk moth visits a petunia flower?
Options:
A. commensal
B. mutualistic
C. parasitic

Hint: Read the text about giant tortoises. The Galápagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean are home to the giant tortoise. These tortoises are massive, weighing nearly five hundred pounds. However, giant tortoises do not use much energy. They often rest for up to sixteen hours a day. And when there is little water, giant tortoises might sleep for weeks at a time. This helps them save energy. Giant tortoises can live up to a year without food or water if they have to! Life has not always been easy for giant tortoises, though. When people first arrived at the Galápagos Islands hundreds of years ago, they took many of the tortoises away. And some people hunted the tortoises for food and oil. Few tortoises are left on the island today. Luckily, many groups of people are now working to keep these giant animals safe. Hopefully, giant tortoises can roam the islands for many years to come.
Question: When might a giant tortoise sleep for weeks at a time?
Options:
A. when there is not much water
B. when the tortoise is growing quickly
C. when it is cold outside

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below. Isaac was a landscape architect who was hired to design a new city park. The city council wanted the park to have space for outdoor concerts and to have at least 20% of the park shaded by trees. Isaac thought the concert area should be at least 150 meters from the road so traffic noise didn't interrupt the music. He developed three possible designs for the park with the concert area in a different location in each design. Then, he tested each design by measuring the distance between the road and the concert area. Figure: studying an architect's design.
Question: Which of the following could Isaac's test show?
Options:
A. which design would have the greatest distance between the concert area and the road
B. if at least 20% of the park would be shaded by trees in each design
C. which design would have the least traffic noise in the concert area

The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below. Pam was designing small aircraft called drones to pick up items from warehouse shelves. She knew that the drones' propeller blades would get damaged if they bumped into anything while flying through the warehouse. So, Pam wanted to add blade guards to protect the propeller blades. The guards had to be sturdy so they would not break in a crash. But she thought that if the guards weighed too much, the drones would not fly well. So, Pam put guards made of lightweight metal on one drone. Then she observed how well the drone flew with the guards. Figure: a drone without blade guards.
Question: Which of the following could Pam's test show?
Options:
A. how much the drone weighed with the blade guards
B. if the blade guards would break in a crash
C. if adding the blade guards made the drone fly poorly

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below. Rhianna glued lids onto 16 cardboard shoe boxes of equal size. She painted eight of the boxes black and eight of the boxes white. Rhianna made a small hole in the side of each box and then stuck a thermometer partially into each hole so she could measure the temperatures inside the boxes. She placed the boxes in direct sunlight in her backyard. Two hours later, she measured the temperature inside each box. Rhianna compared the average temperature inside the black boxes to the average temperature inside the white boxes. Figure: a shoebox painted black.
Question: Identify the question that Rhianna's experiment can best answer.
Options:
A. Do the insides of white boxes get hotter than the insides of black boxes when the boxes are left in the sun?
B. Do the temperatures inside boxes depend on the sizes of the boxes?

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below. Kenji was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft. So, to help decide how big the vent should be, Kenji put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung. Figure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.
Question: Which of the following could Kenji's test show?
Options:
A. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour
B. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour
C. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour

Hint: Read the text about cat meows. While kittens meow to their mothers, they stop once they are old enough to take care of themselves. At that point, cats use smell, touch, and body language to talk to each other. So if adult cats aren't making noise for each other, why do cats meow? Cats meow to talk with their humans! If you are a cat owner, you may be interested in understanding your cat's meows. Different meows can have distinct meanings. A short, high squeak or chirp is a cheerful hello. A louder and longer meow is a cat's way of saying "Please?" or "Let me out!" An even longer and louder meow is your cat's way of demanding something, like "Food! Now!" Of course, the best cat sound to many cat owners is a low, rumbling purr that comes from a happy cat.
Question: Why do adult cats meow?
Options:
A. to act like kittens
B. to talk to other cats
C. to talk to people

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below. Ben put one two-inch steel nail into each of six test tubes. He added water to three of the test tubes and vinegar to the other three. In each test tube, he completely covered the nail with the same volume of liquid. Ben checked the nails for rust at the same time every day. He recorded how many days it took each nail to become completely covered in rust. Then, he compared the number of days it took nails to rust in water to the number of days it took nails to rust in vinegar. Figure: a new steel nail on a pile of rusty nails.
Question: Identify the question that Ben's experiment can best answer.
Options:
A. Do steel nails rust in fewer days when submerged in a large volume of liquid compared to a small volume?
B. Do steel nails take fewer days to rust in water compared to vinegar?

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below. Joy was designing small aircraft called drones to pick up items from warehouse shelves. She knew that the drones' propeller blades would get damaged if they bumped into anything while flying through the warehouse. So, Joy wanted to add blade guards to protect the propeller blades. The guards had to be sturdy so they would not break in a crash. But she thought that if the guards weighed too much, the drones would not fly well. So, Joy put guards made of lightweight metal on one drone. Then she observed how well the drone flew with the guards. Figure: a drone without blade guards.
Question: Which of the following could Joy's test show?
Options:
A. if the blade guards would break in a crash
B. how much the drone weighed with the blade guards
C. if adding the blade guards made the drone fly poorly

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below. Duncan was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft. So, to help decide how big the vent should be, Duncan put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung. Figure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.
Question: Which of the following could Duncan's test show?
Options:
A. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour
B. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour
C. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below. Caden was a mechanical engineer who was designing to record temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. The weather station would be used in a town where the highest recorded temperature was 40°C. Caden wanted to make sure the weather station would work even in unusually warm weather. So, he set an indoor test chamber to 50°C with low moisture and no wind. He left the weather station in the chamber overnight. The next day, he checked to see if the weather station displayed accurate measurements after 24 hours at 50°C. Figure: a weather station.
Question: Which of the following could Caden's test show?
Options:
A. how well the weather station would work when it was windy
B. if the weather station would work when the temperature was 50°C

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment. Read the passage and think about the variables that are described. Kamal noticed that some of the footballs his team used during practice were not fully inflated. He wondered whether fully inflated footballs would travel farther than footballs with a lower air pressure. To find out, Kamal collected 20 standard footballs. He fully inflated ten of them to an air pressure of 13 pounds per square inch. He inflated the remaining ten to an air pressure of 10 pounds per square inch. Kamal used to launch a ball across a football field. He measured the distance the football traveled and then launched the next ball. Kamal repeated this with all 20 balls. Hint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating. A dependent variable is a variable that you measure. Figure: a football launcher.
Question: Which of the following was a dependent variable in this experiment?
Options:
A. the distance the footballs traveled
B. the air pressure in the footballs

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below. Martina and Kiera were making batches of concrete for a construction project. To make the concrete, they mixed together dry cement powder, gravel, and water. Then, they checked if each batch was firm enough using a test called a slump test. They poured some of the fresh concrete into an upside-down metal cone. They left the concrete in the metal cone for 30 seconds. Then, they lifted the cone to see if the concrete stayed in a cone shape or if it collapsed. If the concrete in a batch collapsed, they would know the batch should not be used. Figure: preparing a concrete slump test.
Question: Which of the following could Martina and Kiera's test show?
Options:
A. if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use
B. if the concrete from each batch took the same amount of time to dry

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment. Jason and his neighbors wanted to attract more woodpeckers to their yards. They read that woodpeckers often eat sunflower seeds. The neighbors wanted to find out if filling their bird feeders with sunflower seeds would increase the number of woodpeckers that visited their yards. So, four of the neighbors filled their feeders with sunflower seeds. Another four neighbors left their feeders empty. Every morning for a month, the neighbors counted the number of woodpeckers they saw in their yards. Figure: a woodpecker at a bird feeder.

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below. Brody put one two-inch steel nail into each of six test tubes. He added water to three of the test tubes and vinegar to the other three. In each test tube, he completely covered the nail with the same volume of liquid. Brody checked the nails for rust at the same time every day. He recorded how many days it took each nail to become completely covered in rust. Then, he compared the number of days it took nails to rust in water to the number of days it took nails to rust in vinegar. Figure: a new steel nail on a pile of rusty nails.
Question: Identify the question that Brody's experiment can best answer.

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below. Harold was a mechanical engineer who was designing to record temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. The weather station would be used in a town where the highest recorded temperature was 40°C. Harold wanted to make sure the weather station would work even in unusually warm weather. So, he set an indoor test chamber to 50°C with low moisture and no wind. He left the weather station in the chamber overnight. The next day, he checked to see if the weather station displayed accurate measurements after 24 hours at 50°C. Figure: a weather station.
Question: Which of the following could Harold's test show?
Options:
A. if the weather station would work when the temperature was 50°C
B. how well the weather station would work when it was windy

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment. Read the passage and think about the variables that are described. Duncan grew ten on his back porch. He grew each plant in its own pot, and each pot was the same size and shape. Duncan noticed that his plants did not grow many leaves, and he wanted to see if earthworms could help them grow more. To test this idea, Duncan divided his ten plants into two equal groups. For one group, he added three earthworms to the soil in each pot. He did not add any earthworms to pots in the other group. Two months later, Duncan counted the number of leaves on each of the ten plants. He compared the number of leaves on the plants in each group. Hint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating. A dependent variable is a variable that you measure. Figure: mint plants.

Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below. Manny was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft. So, to help decide how big the vent should be, Manny put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung. Figure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.
Question: Which of the following could Manny's test show?
Options:
A. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour
B. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour
C. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour

Hint: Read the text. All animals that live on land have some sort of skeletal system. Some animals have what is called an endoskeleton. They have a system of connected bones inside their bodies. This skeleton grows as the animal grows. This helps to support a larger body. Other animals have what is called an exoskeleton. An exoskeleton is a hard covering on the outside of an animal's body. Exoskeletons do not change size, so they must be shed and replaced as an animal grows.
Question: Which term matches the picture?

A. endoskeleton

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below. Ashley built an electric circuit: she used wires to connect a battery to a light bulb, the light bulb to a small piece of copper, and the copper back to the battery. When the circuit was complete, the light turned on. Ashley observed the brightness of the light for five seconds. She then replaced the copper with a piece of iron of equal size and noted whether the light became brighter or dimmer. Ashley built three more of the same type of circuit. She repeated the tests with each circuit. Ashley recorded whether the circuits produced brighter light when the circuit included copper or when the circuit included iron. Figure: a circuit with a battery, a light bulb, and a piece of copper.
Question: Identify the question that Ashley's experiment can best answer.
Options:
A. Do circuits that include iron produce dimmer light than circuits that include copper?
B. Can light bulbs stay lit longer when circuits include copper or when circuits include iron?

Hint: This passage describes the wing type trait in fruit flies: Some scientists breed fruit flies to learn how traits are inherited. These scientists often use flies with vestigial wings, which are shorter and stubbier than normal wings. Fruit flies with vestigial wings cannot fly, so they are easier for scientists to handle and study. In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have normal wings and others have vestigial wings. In this group, the gene for the wing type trait has two alleles. The allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N). This Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies.
Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with vestigial wings to offspring with normal wings? Choose the most likely ratio.
Options:
A. 1:3
B. 4:0
C. 3:1
D. 2:2

Hint: The passage below describes an experiment. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below. Camilla glued lids onto 16 cardboard shoe boxes of equal size. She painted eight of the boxes black and eight of the boxes white. Camilla made a small hole in the side of each box and then stuck a thermometer partially into each hole so she could measure the temperatures inside the boxes. She placed the boxes in direct sunlight in her backyard. Two hours later, she measured the temperature inside each box. Camilla compared the average temperature inside the black boxes to the average temperature inside the white boxes. Figure: a shoebox painted black.
Question: Identify the question that Camilla's experiment can best answer.
Options:
A. Do the temperatures inside boxes depend on the sizes of the boxes?
B. Do the insides of white boxes get hotter than the insides of black boxes when the boxes are left in the sun?

Hint: Read the text. Filtration and centrifugation are two techniques used to separate different materials from a mixture. Filtration involves straining unwanted materials, sometimes with the help of gravity. For example, you can pour a liquid mixture through a funnel lined with filter paper that collects unwanted solids. Centrifugation, on the other hand, uses centrifugal force to separate materials. For example, vials of mixtures can be placed at an angle in special machines that spin at high speed. The spinning causes denser substances to move and collect at the bottom of the vial.
Question: Which term matches the picture?
Options:
A. filtration
B. centrifugation

Hint: The following passage describes the effects of a gene mutation, which is a permanent change in a gene. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below. Keratins are strong proteins that provide structure and protection for many tissues in the human body. For example, the tissue on the inside of the mouth, called epithelium (ep-i-THEEL-i-um), is protected by a tough layer made of many types of keratin proteins connected together. One type of keratin protein is encoded by the KRT13 gene. A certain person had a mutation in the KRT13 gene. Compared to the KRT13 gene without a mutation, the mutated KRT13 gene encoded a form of the keratin protein with a different structure. This different form of the keratin protein could not connect to other keratin proteins.The person with the mutation had mouth epithelium that was easily damaged by simple activities like eating and brushing teeth. Figure: strands of connected keratin proteins, seen through a high-powered microscope.
Question: Complete the sentence.
The mutation in the () affected the structure and function of the ().
Options:
A. KRT13 gene . . . keratin protein
B. keratin protein . . . KRT13 gene
